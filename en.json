    "first_section_1": "Sacith started its activity in <span class='text-primary'>2004</span>, focusing on the production of very high-tech components for air-massage systems. In a very short period Sacith has become the first supplier of air-system components for the most important Italian whirlpool brands.",
    "first_section_2": "In 2006, we produced the <span class='text-primary'>SACITRONIC</span>, winning the challenge of realizing an electromechanical control for pumps, responding to safety regulations, without the need of electronic devices. SACITRONIC is covered by an International Patent.",
    "img_title_1": "Technological Innovation",
    "second_section": "In 2009, just after the Italian whirlpool components producer Aquajet closed its activity, Sacith took over a significant part of its moulds and patents, enlarging its range of products with a complete series of hydro-massage components and granting also a continuation of sales and support to the clients who used to buy from Aquajet. Passion for technical solutions is the spirit that is aiming this company and the satisfaction of clientsâ€™ special needs is our mission.",
    "img_title_2": "Finest Quality",
    "third_section_1": "We are firmly convinced that good business relationships are based on four important points:",

    "third_section_3": "- <span class='text-primary'>Quality</span> of the components, that is convincing the client to go on testing them;",
    "third_section_4": "- <span class='text-primary'>Service</span> that a supplier must grant to satisfy special requests or to answer normal questions;",
    "third_section_5": "- <span class='text-primary'>Perseverance</span> and <span class='text-primary'>mutual trust</span> that are the ingredients for a long lasting relationship.",
